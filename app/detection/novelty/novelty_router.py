app/detection/novelty/novelty_router.py

Routes structural novelty findings to:
  1. novelty_queue table in PostgreSQL (developer review queue)
  2. Red Team service (immediate escalation when same pattern seen 10+ times)

Called from app/api/v1/score.py AFTER the full scoring pipeline completes.
NEVER modifies fraud_score. NEVER creates investigator alerts.
Creates its own DB session — safe to run in a thread pool after the request session closes.
All exceptions are caught — failure here must never affect scoring responses.
